Works with tuya-convert, no need to open it up.

A week after sucessfully converting a numbber of these units the remaainder from the same purchase 
would not convert due to newer firmware: Opening them (which is difficult but possible) allowed them
to be converted. Lastest batch I purchased has WB2S module which is Arm Cortex-M4 based and not compatible
but FCC ID numer and all other external markings are the same: Still bears FCC ID: 2AQUQGPTYWE2S even though 
module is now a WB2S instead of TYWE2S.
